## Features

- **Game Time**: few titles, long sessions. Defaults to 3 games for 10h each.
- **Game Variety**: the whole detectable catalog, short sessions. Defaults to all titles for 1h each.
- **Streaming**: headless Go Live through the gateway, voice WebSocket and UDP silence frames. Defaults to 1h and auto-stops.
- **Level up all**: asks for all three up front, then runs them in order.
- **Inspect Profile**: lists the badges currently on your account.
- **Smart stream targets**: scans your servers for busy voice channels, skips AFK channels and checks Go Live permissions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer
- Windows (fingerprint option and Enter-to-stop use Windows APIs)
- `cryptography` for encrypted silence frames while streaming. It is installed automatically on first run if missing.

## Quick run

PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinfal/BadgeMaxxer/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

This downloads BadgeMaxxer and the Watcher into `%USERPROFILE%\BadgeMaxxer`, installs the Python packages, and starts it. Your `session.json` is never overwritten.

## Usage

```bash
python badgemaxxer.py
```

On first run it asks for your account token and a `cf_clearance` cookie, then saves them to `session.json` next to the script. Use **Refresh Credentials & Cookie** in the menu to update them later.

| Menu option | What it does |
|---|---|
| Level up all | Game Time, Game Variety and Streaming in one run |
| Game Time | Long sessions on a few games |
| Game Variety | Short sessions across many games |
| Streaming | Headless Go Live in a voice channel |
| Inspect Discord Profile & Badges | Shows the badges on your profile |
| Refresh Credentials & Cookie | Updates cookie and analytics token |
| Configure Executable Fingerprint | Optional, Windows only |
| Exit | Quit |

## Streaming requirements

For stream time to count:

1. A second account or a friend must sit in the voice channel. Streaming alone in an empty channel is not counted.
2. **Use data to personalize my Discord experience** must be on (User Settings > Data & Privacy).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `badgemaxxer.py` | The whole tool |
| `session.json` | Token, cookie, fingerprint and totals (created on first run) |
| `../data/games.json` | Cached games catalog from `cdn.discordapp.com/detectables/games.json`. Delete it to refresh. |

## Notes

- Badge progress usually syncs within 24 to 48 hours.
- `session.json` holds your token and cookie in plaintext. Never share or commit it.

## Disclaimer

This tool uses a user token and sends generated telemetry and streaming activity, which violates Discord's Terms of Service. Accounts using it can be banned. Use a throwaway account, at your own risk. This project is not affiliated with Discord.
